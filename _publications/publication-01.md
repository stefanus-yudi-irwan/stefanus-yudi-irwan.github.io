excerpt: 'This paper proposes a new control structure for coal mills using cascade control, a blend station, and feedback control to improve coal flow, primary air flow, and pulverized coal temperature regulation. The evaluation shows that the new system achieves better performance, reducing settling time to 161.75 seconds with 0% overshoot while maintaining coal fineness at 70%–75% and moisture content at 2.18%–2.28%.'

The inability of the coal mill control structure to monitor and control pulverized coal ﬂow causes operational and environmental problems. The research was done to design the new control structure for coal mill in coal firing system to achieve an improvement on control system performance compared to the existing control structure. Cascade control, blend station, and feedback control was used to control the ﬂow of coal, the ﬂow of primary air, and temperature of the pulverized coal. The result of the evaluation shows that the new control structure capable of fulfilling all the control objectives applied to it. Implementation of the new control structure capable to make the step response of the coal mill to have an average settling time at 161.75 seconds with 0% overshoot. The new control structure also capable to make the pulverized coal fineness at the range of 70% to 75% and moisture content at the range of 2.18% to 2.28%. The result of the evaluation makes the control performance of the new control structure is better than the previous coal mill control structure.
