excerpt: 'This paper discusses the development of a coal mill simulator for indirect pulverized coal firing systems using the IEC 61499 automation standard. The simulator, built with 4DIAC for distributed modeling and Eclipse NeoSCADA for the human-machine interface, reduces memory usage by up to 2.29% and allows users to operate the system through tutor and student stations using at least 17 interconnected resources.'

Coal mill operation and control are becoming a major problem in the industry because it has an inherent difficulty to operate. The manufacturing industry requires distributed, modular, and flexible control system, to face the higher innovation speed, reduced time to market and shortened product life cycles. This paper intends to explain the development of coal mill simulator for indirect pulverized coal firing system based on automation standard IEC 61499. The well-known IEC 61499 framework, i.e. 4DIAC was used to develop the distributed model, while Eclipse NeoSCADA was used to develop the human-machine interface. Utilization of 4DIAC and Eclipse NeoSCADA able to make the simulator as a distributed system by utilizing interconnected computers. Implementation of the model into resources also shows that there is a decrease in memory usage for about 1.31% for two resources and 2.29% for three resources. The user of the simulator will be able to experience how to operate the plant by using two different kinds of interface, there are tutor station and student station. The simulation can be implemented by using at least 17 resources consist of 1 process and control resources, and 16 communication resources in mini PC Celeron Dual Core 1.5 GHz CPU.
