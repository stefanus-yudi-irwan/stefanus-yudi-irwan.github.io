excerpt: "Use logistic regression, naïve Bayes, and word vectors to implement sentiment analysis, complete analogies & translate words. Use recurrent neural networks, LSTMs, GRUs & Siamese networks for sentiment analysis, text generation & named entity recognition. Use dynamic programming, hidden Markov models, and word embeddings to implement autocorrect, autocomplete & identify part-of-speech tags for words. Use encoder-decoder, causal, & self-attention to machine translate complete sentences, summarize text, and answer questions."
