# ðŸ¥¾ Stefanus Yudi Irwan 

**`AI Engineer (Engineer/Programmer/Hiker)`**

I am an enthusiastic Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer with experience in developing, optimizing, and deploying AI-driven solutions. My expertise covers the full machine learning lifecycle, from data preprocessing to model deployment. I have a strong interest in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their real-world applications, as well as Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques like sentiment analysis and text summarization. Additionally, I have a keen interest in Recommendation Systems, leveraging collaborative filtering, content-based methods, and hybrid approaches to create personalized experiences and drive user engagement.

## ðŸ’» Coding Journey
<ul> 
<li><strong>Final Thesis Project</strong></li>
I actually start my coding journey when I tackled my undergraduate thesis entitle "The Development of Coal Mill Control Structure Using IEC 61499 Standard". In sort, i use IEC 61499 block diagram to simulate a differential equation representing a dinamic process of a coal mill, and its control structure to maintain the mill process meet requirements. I used 4DIAC as a platform for dinamic modelling instread of MATLAB. Eclipse SCADA for visualization, at the end i found that this Eclipse SCADA is based on Javascript, also I created node-Red version which turn out could replace the Eclipse SCANA. Finally, MQTT communication chanel to connect the dinamic simulation modeling to the visualization of the plant.

<br>
<li><strong>Pacmann Bootcamp</strong></li>
After coding vacum (worked as engineer), I join a well known bootcamp in Indonesia to strengthen my coding skills and get coding environment. I focused to study about Data Analysis first, then stepped up to Machine Learning and Deep Learning. In the beginning I learn a lot about Python and SQL, then about Probability and Data visualization. I studied these first because these 4 module is the core of Data Analyst. Moving from Data Analyst I began to learn about traditional machine learning algorithm and deloyment. Finaly after basic and advance machine leanring, I learn cutting edge artifical intelligence technology such as deep learning and natural language processing.

<br>
<li><strong>Operation Strategist: Indodana</strong></li>
My first job as Analyst was in A leading Fintech Company in Indonesia. I worked closely with operation division as Strategist. Most of the time I involve in Operation Managerial meeting to direct the operation activity and regularly make an improvement. I use a lot of Google Sheet and Excel, hence I learned a lot about Excel and Google Sheet formula, which ease my work to form a report or analyze small scale dataset. I dealt a lot with loan data, and work closely with collector manager. Moreover I also work closely with operational quality assurance and improve its operational workflow together with QA manager. 
<br>
<br>
<li><strong>Data Scientist: KG Media</strong></li>
My second data job is as Data Scientist in KG Media, a well known media company in Indonesia. I am working closely with recommendation system, and the use of Artificial Intelligence to support other function in this company. I dealt with model development, its deployment and backend infrastructure to underpin the machine learning model to do respective particular tasks.

<li><strong>Senior Tech Consultant Data & AI: EY Indonesia</strong></li>
Now I am working Data and AI Tech Consultant for EY Indonesia, developing Data Solutions for Clients
