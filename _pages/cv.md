Interest
======
<p align="justify">
I am an enthusiastic Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer with experience in developing, optimizing, and deploying AI-driven solutions. My expertise covers the full machine learning lifecycle, from data preprocessing to model deployment. I have a strong interest in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their real-world applications, as well as Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques like sentiment analysis and text summarization. Additionally, I have a keen interest in Recommendation Systems, leveraging collaborative filtering, content-based methods, and hybrid approaches to create personalized experiences and drive user engagement.
